# WitheredFoxyLinux
Inspired by the mod "1/10000 Chance for Withered Foxy Jumpscare Every Second", this is a adaptation of the mod to the whole XFCE/Gnome (Tested) Window managers. Once you execute foxy.sh, every second you'll hace a chance of 1/10000 every second for Withered Foxy to jumpscare you

# Dependences
 - Python3 and PyQt6
 - XFCE or Gnome (Only tested these two, could work with other window managers)

# Features
  - Jumpscare over your apps, happening on top, so it won't close anything, it will just jump over your current opened app
  - Jumpscare sound
  - Audio automatically set to 100% and then back to original %
  - 1/10000 chances of happening every second

  - You can force the jumpscare by doing ./foxy.sh -now
  - You might need to chmod a+x ./foxy.sh to get it working

# Personal Recomendation
  - Make foxy.sh start with the session, so every time you power on your PC, Withered Foxy can Jumpscare you or whoever you install this to without even remembering it was installed
